           <strong>American Indian College Fund!</strong><br />
           This site has helped me a ton when I was attending a Tribal College. I recieved a $500 fund every semester after I first started in Fall 2019, this helped me tremendously. I'd recommend this to anyone in Tribal College because it is totally worth the effort to apply. I later won a juicy scholarship of almost $4000 dollars in 2021 through the American Indian Graduate Center! Amazing oppurtunities for my young Native students.
