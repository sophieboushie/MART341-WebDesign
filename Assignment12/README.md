I tried to incorporate sizing, padding, borders, margin, overflow and display. I got a bit confused trying to differenciate between all the elements. My main focus was making sure the links and displays work together in a simple but efficient way. This site is related to my previous MMIW site so I linked it in the home tab, but I wouldn't say it's a follow up page, just made with the same idea! I want to say my websites have been having a hard time being hosted on github, I still am not sure why but I hope nothing gets lost!
