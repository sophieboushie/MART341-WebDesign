I wanted to aim for a soft background color and rich colors for the headers. I am happy with how the colors worked out together. I made some adjustments with the list, I think keeping it at 5 items instead of 8 like I first thought was a smart move. 8 things being listed would've looked too bulky, I didn't want that. I find I struggle with closing my commands while coding, like missing the closing brackets and then worried about where I messed up. I think times are hard for everyone, it's palpable within my community at least. Therapy helps though so I am feeling a bit better! Lots of fun selecting the colors for my background, I loved that you could mess with the colors more in dephth.
