I started by brainstorming ideas for this assignment, and chose to make a product page for the Churu cat treats, a page about my cats favorite flavor, and a product information page with prices and varieties. I followed the Bootstrap page for inserting the CSS code into the head of the page and JS code before closing the body. Using Bootstrap on the first page is helping me a ton with layout and design. I struggle with placements but this feels a lot easier to work with and understand, so I like that! The product page will have two churu treat pictures with their prices listed, this was a bit hard to get working. Adding images always messes me up but I looked at my previous code and looked up examples to link it correctly. The PetTreats in the top left corner acts as a home button, I thought it would be satisfying to add because I always click the logo or title on pages to go back to the front page. I just copied the product descriptions from a sale website, along with the prices.
