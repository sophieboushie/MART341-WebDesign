# How's the course going for you so far? The semester?
## B A D and I am tired

This semester is already too long and confusing as I'm only taking one class that I *wanted* to take, but I am trying to find the joy for my other classes again. Coding is really daunting but I hope to understand the terms more and gain confidence with my work. Surely once the weather is sunnier it'll get easier, **surely** .

### Things That Help
- Therapy *Sunflower Counseling*
- My cat **fat**
- Setting a routine
- Music
